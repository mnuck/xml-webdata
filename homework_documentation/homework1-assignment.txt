Design a small WebSQL prototype to run WEBSQL queries.

Implement these 3 queries: 

Q1. Starting from the Department of Computer Science home page (you can use any), 
    find all documents that are linked through paths of length two or less containing only local links. 
    Keep only the documents containing the string ‘faculty’ in their title.

Q2. "SELECT d2.base, d2.label 
     FROM document d1 anchor d2 
     SUCH THAT d1 MENTIONS XML 
     WHERE d1.length > 100"


Q3.   SELECT d.url 
      FROM document d SUCH THAT "http://the.starting.doc" ->* d, 
           document d1 SUCH THAT d=>|->=>d1 
           anchor a SUCH THAT base = d1 
      WHERE a.href = “your server";

Recommended Implementation: Java Servlets

How to submit: 
You are required to submit the HW using blackboard, and setup a time for demo. 
The demo should be over by 29th Sept. You must submit the HW by the due date 
and no more changes are allowed after your submission.

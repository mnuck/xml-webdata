XML and Webdata
Homework 4


Hello grader!

This file provides a roadmap of our code, as it relates to the homework assignment.


Task 1.1 Schemas for each of the data types are found in:
Course_Schema.txt
Faculty_Schema.txt
Office_Schema.txt
Phone_Schema.txt


Task 1.2 Each data type is parsed into its own XML file by a parse*.py program
parseCourse.py
parseFaculty.py
parseOffice.py
parsePhone.py

The outputs of these programs lands in a corresponding *.xml file
Course.xml
Faculty.xml
Office.xml
Phone.xml

These four xml files are the concatenated into a Things.xml file, strictly for ease of handling. 

cat *.xml > Things.xml


Task 2 is handled by xquery_queries.py

This program depends on the Zorba (http://zorba.io) XQuery parsing engine, which has very finicky installation requirements. It is a short program, and the queries are labelled. Output from this program lands in 6 different output files:
xquery1.out
xquery2.out.html
xquery3.out
xquery4.out
xquery5.out
xquery6.out


Tasks 3 is handled by parseToDB.py

This program uses the SQLite3 database engine, parsing the input data into an in-memory database. The tables and schemas needed are generated by the create_tables() function, starting on line 232.


Task 4 is handled by parseToDB.py

Querys start at line 268.
